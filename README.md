# Library System

This Library System is a lightweight and efficient backend service designed to manage inventory or personal item records. It is ideal for building item tracking systems, digital inventory apps, or tools for cataloging resources. Built with simplicity and speed in mind, the project leverages modern JavaScript tooling and a modular structure, ensuring it is both developer-friendly and easily extendable.

## Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to offer a RESTful API backend that can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on items. It enables authenticated users to store, update, retrieve, and manage items through a set of structured API endpoints. Whether for personal organization or small business inventory management, the API provides a solid foundation for item-related data storage.

## Technologies Used
The project uses Bun, a modern JavaScript runtime known for its speed, as the server environment. Configuration files like package.json, postcss.config.js, and eslint.config.js indicate the use of advanced developer tooling and code standards enforcement. The API appears to be structured using JavaScript or TypeScript modules and uses a minimalistic design philosophy.

While no traditional backend framework like Express is visible, the use of bun.lockb and modular imports suggests native HTTP handling with Bun's built-in capabilities. Static files like index.html and configurations like components.json imply optional frontend support or testing via browser.

## Key Features
1.CRUD Functionality: Users can add new items, view stored items, update item details, and delete entries.

2.API Documentation: The included API_DOCUMENTATION.md outlines the endpoints, parameters, and expected request/response formats, ensuring ease of integration.

3.Scalability & Performance: By leveraging Bun, the API is optimized for fast startup, reduced latency, and low overheadâ€”ideal for microservices or serverless deployment.

## Use Case and Real-World Application
This project is suitable for developers or small teams building lightweight inventory systems, personal organizers, or task tracking tools. It can be integrated with a frontend app or used as a microservice in larger systems.

Its clean codebase, modern tooling, and clear documentation make it an excellent foundation for expanding into a full-stack application or deploying as a backend service.
